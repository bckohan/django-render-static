"""
The `url_to_js` tag avoids error prone string processing by using Django's
`reverse` mechanism to generate the URLs to embed in the javascript. To do the
reversal it needs temporary placeholder values to feed in as kwargs or args.
There aren't reliable or license friendly libraries available to generate the
placeholders directly from the regular expressions so users are relied upon to
supply them. This module provides facilities for registering and resolving
those placeholders. It also contains some predefined placeholders for the admin
module.

Users are strongly encouraged to use paths instead of re_paths and to supply
custom converters when needed to avoid the need for re_paths. This should make
the placeholder registration process as painless as possible. All of the
builtin converters already have placeholders registered for them. Custom
converters can simply add a `placeholder` class attribute that will be used
without requiring an explicit registration.

    .. note::
        Many placeholders may be registered for a variable name/app_name.
        They'll be tried until one is found to work, and prioritized in the
        order of most specific registration. This means a placeholder
        registered against app1 and variable name var1 will be tried before the
        placeholder registered against var1. Converters are the most specific
        registration info.
