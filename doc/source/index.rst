Introduction
============

Use Django's template engines to render static files that are collected
during the ``collectstatic`` routine and likely served above Django at runtime.
Files rendered by django-render-static are immediately available to participate
in the normal static file collection pipeline.

For example, a frequently occurring pattern that violates the
`DRY principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`_ is the
presence of defines, or enum like structures in server side Python code that are
simply replicated in client side JavaScript. Another example might be rebuilding
Django URLs from arguments in a `Single Page Application <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application>`_.
Single-sourcing these structures by transpiling client side code from the server
side code keeps the stack bone DRY.

`django-render-static` includes Python to Javascript transpilers for:
    - Django's `reverse` function (`urls_to_js`)
    - PEP 435 style Python enumerations (`enums_to_js`)
    - Plain data define-like structures in Python classes and modules
      (`defines_to_js`)


`django-render-static` also formalizes the concept of a package-time or deployment-time
static file rendering step. It piggybacks off the existing templating engines and configurations
and should therefore be familiar to Django developers. It supports both standard Django templating
and Jinja templates and allows contexts to be specified in python, json or YAML.
