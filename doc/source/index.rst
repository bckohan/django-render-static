Introduction
============

Use Django's dynamic templates to render static files. That is, files that are collected
during the ``collectstatic`` routine and likely served above Django on the stack. Static
templates should be rendered preceding any run of ``collectstatic``.

For example, a frequently occurring pattern that violates the DRY principle is the presence of
defines, or enum like structures in server side Python code that are simply replicated in client
side JavaScript. Single-sourcing these structures by generating client side code from the server
side code maintains DRYness.

`django-render-static` includes builtins for:
    - Replicating Django's `reverse` function in JavaScript (:ref:`urls_to_js`)
    - Auto-translating Python class and module structures into JavaScript
      (:ref:`modules_to_js`, :ref:`classes_to_js`)
